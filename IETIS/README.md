# IETIS Library

Infinity Engine Library for TIS file format

> The TIS file format describes a tileset (Palette-based or PVRZ-based). TIS files are generally comprised of a large number of tiles, each of which consists of a palette and a rectangular block of pixels. Each pixel is an index into the associated palette. Each tile has its own palette and a block of pixels.
