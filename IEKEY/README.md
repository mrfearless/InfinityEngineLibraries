# IEKEY Library

Infinity Engine Library for KEY file format

> The KEY file format acts as a central reference point to locate files required by the game (in a BIFF file on a CD or in the override directory). The key file also maintains a mapping from a resource name to a 32 byte ID. There is generally only one key file with each game (chitin.key).
